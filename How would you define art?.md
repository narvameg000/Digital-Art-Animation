How would you define art?
I would define art as a multi-media project that evokes a feeling within the viewer through their senses but more so through their sense of sight.

1.
There are plenty of works with which I personally feel aren't art. For example modern art will always remain as a debatable ideology for me because to me they are forcing an emotion and feeling into an "artwork". Not everything that is made is considered art. 

I feel that some works are art and some arent' because to me, I need to see something visually to be able to judge it and view it as a work that is supposed to express some sort of ideology of evoke any feelings the artist had while creating it.

2.
I believe the definition of art will always be static but the criteria for what is art and what isn't art will be dynamic.
With new perspectives we will have more new art that will fit with that criteria. New eras of art will bring new ideas but the idea of art by itself will remain the same.
