Victor Vasarely:
Contemporary | Hungarian-French 

b: 1906 - d: 1997 

Victor Vasarely is an internationally known and praised artist; widely accepted as a "grandfather" and leader of the op art movement.

Vasarely studied traditional academic painting at the private Podolini-Volkmann Academy. In 1928/29, he enrolled at Sándor Bortnyik's private art school, Műhely (lit. "Workshop"), then widely recognized as Budapest's centre of Bauhaus studies. Due to limited funds, the Műhely could not offer all that the Bauhaus offered. Instead it concentrated on applied graphic art and typographical design.
