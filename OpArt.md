What is Op Art? Describe it in your own words.

Op Art is an abstract form of art that resembles/similar to those optical illusions where you can see movement and are 
often times balck and white

How do you feel about it?

I personally feel that they are a cool form of art because you have to form it very carefully for it to have any effect
on the viewer.

Find four different resources that help you understand what OP Art is. For each link, state why you chose that particular
resource, and why you found it useful.

1.https://www.tate.org.uk/kids/explore/what-is/op-art
I chose this website to help me understand op art because it rids me of my previous assumptions that they have to look a
certain way for it to be perceived as op art. They include several pieces that are not similar but are still considered to
be op art as they define it. They define it as: Artists use shapes, colours and patterns in special waysto create images
that look as if they are moving or blurring.

2.https://www.britannica.com/art/Op-art
On this website they explain in detail the different ways it can be interpreted to be op art. I also explains of the how
it came to be and why it got so popular but not amongst other artist.

3.http://www.artmovements.co.uk/opart.htm
This website explains who were the few artist that were involved in making and creating this new media creation, that is
now called op art. They presented us to the movement’s leading figures who were Bridget Riley and Victor Vasarely, and how
other arists such as Eric Olsen and Francisco Sobrino used layers of different coloured perspex to create a similar illusion
of distortion.

4.https://www.theartstory.org/movement-op-art.htm
This goes very in depth about how the op art movement changed the art community and how many styles of op art differred from
artist to artist but could still be considered op art. Many artist of the time could interpret op art in their own way but
still bring out what defines op art by putting their own spin to it, either by color, shapes, etc..

The three best known op artists are probably Bridget Riley, Victor Vasarely, and Richard Anuszkiewicz.
So... I don't want you to choose any of them because you'd probably all have them in your list.

Name: Jean-Pierre Yvaral
Date of Birth: January 25, 1934 - August 2, 2002,
Born where: Paris, France
Works: 
Opinion:
I love his works because they give off the VHS static type of aesthetic with all the different toned down colors he uses. some appear to look like it came from a game, such as pac-man.

Name: Frank Stella
Date of Birth: May 12, 1936
Born where: Malden, MA
Works:
Opinion:
He uses color to make it seem that some objects are infront of another but it is only the color that is being changed if you look closely at the design.

Name:Jesús Rafael Soto
Date of Birth: June 5, 1923- January 14, 2005
Born where: Ciudad Bolívar, Venezuela 
Works:
Opinion:
This piece of work is op art because the creator, Jesus Rafael, uses string or wires to hang and he paints parts of it. While it hangs onto the ceiling if forms a 3D shape which the audience can see. This is an op artwork because it isn't what it appears to be but because of the colors it makes it look like it is there.
